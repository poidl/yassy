Oscillator:
*) make blit_4t() dependent of fs, use fs during initialization
*) valgrind shows invalid reads in the following line:
                self.c = -*self.f.offset(self.m as isize + self.i as isize);
*) isn't alpha just twice the phase increment fnn
*) clean up f: (*Box::into_raw(utils::blit_4t())).as_ptr()

Other:
*) there is a GSL dependency in utils
